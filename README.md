# dtu-projects
Projects that have been made as a part of student exchange at Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

## About
This repository has been made to showcase things I have done during my student exchange as Computer Science student at the DTU. Each folder refers to a given course where I have done projects. Within each folder, an explanation of what has been done and what I have learned from it will be provided. This is meant to show my progress and ability to work with different technologies and on different levels. 

## Courses

This repository contains projects from two out of six courses I have attended:

* Introduction to Cyber Systems

* Operating Systems

I have also uploaded a RISC-V simulator from Computer Architecture and Engineering, however as that was a team project done on Github, it has been placed in [a separate repository](https://github.com/binarily/Risc-V-Java-Simulator).

Three other courses have not been listed, as programming has not been their main objective (Algorithms and Data Structures 2), it has been very basic (Introductory Programming) or teamwork was done outside of Github (Introduction to Financial Enginnering).
