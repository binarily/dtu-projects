Projects that have been made as a part of student exchange at Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

## About
This repository has been made to showcase things I have done during my student exchange as Computer Science student at the DTU. Each folder refers to a given course where I have done projects. Within each folder, an explanation of what has been done and what I have learned from it will be provided. This is meant to show my progress and ability to work with different technologies and on different levels.
