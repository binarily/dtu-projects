# operating-systems

All programs created by me as a part of DTU's 02159 "Operating Systems" course. This folder may contain some barebones files provided by the course, however majority of logic has been written by me.

# Files

During this course, the task has been to write an operating system. At the beginning, we were provided with a basic backbone of a system that was only able to boot. In following weeks, we were supposed to create a number of functionalities for this system. The list below provides a basic description of these functionalities:

* Week 5 - procedures for printing strings and hexadecimal numbers on screen.

* Week 6 - system calls, processes, non-preemptive scheduling (processes yield on their own), process termination.

* Week 7 - threading: set up, scheduling, termination.

* Week 8 - mutual exclusion through semaphores.

* Week 9 - memory allocation and deallocation.

* Week 10 - inter-process communication through messaging on ports.

# What I have learned

Throughout this course I have learned about interactions between hardware and software - which tied nicely with another course I have taken, on Computer Architecture and Engineering. This experience of low-level programming - without fancy tools provided by high-level languages - has been an exercise in maintaining an ordered coding style. It has also been a course that at the same time was both difficult and satisfying - it required me to do a lot of work, often that work had been very tiring and sometimes I had to take a break from what I have been doing as I was going too much into it, but when things started to work, the feeling was of pure satisfaction. This course has also shown me substance can be valued over formality - a thing that isn't that obvious elsewhere.
